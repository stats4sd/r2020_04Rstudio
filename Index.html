<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this session, we will guide you through the process of setting up
R and RStudio on your computer, and introduce you some useful tips and
good practice for using RStudio.</p>
<p>The main topics we will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Installing R and RStudio</p></li>
<li><p>What is RStudio?</p></li>
<li><p>Overview of RStudio layout and menus</p></li>
<li><p>Using the markdown file format to write script files</p></li>
<li><p>Installing packages</p></li>
<li><p>Using project files</p></li>
<li><p>Importing data</p></li>
<li><p>Exporting results</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This module is a little different to the previous three modules -
there won’t be any interactive code windows to fill in this workbook -
instead there will be instructions and screenshots that you should try
to replicate on your own computer.</p>
<p>The video for this module gives you a brief tour of these
features:</p>
<p><img src="https://youtu.be/tnuNTyuY-bk" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-installing-r-and-rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2>Installing R and RStudio</h2>
<p>Both R and RStudio are open source software tools, and these can be
downloaded for free. Versions are compatible with nearly all operating
systems.</p>
<p>Even if you have prior installations of R or RStudio on your computer
- please ensure you download and install the most recent versions of
both programs. R and RStudio are both under constant active development
and updated on a regular basis. Some of the RStudio features we talk
about, or functions we cover, in this course may not be available if you
are using an older version of R or RStudio.</p>
<p>The first thing to install is the most recent version of R for your
operating system:
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/" target="_blank">Download
R for Windows</a></p>
<p><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/" target="_blank">Download
R for Mac</a></p>
<p>Once you have completed the installation of R you can download
RStudio, the link below should provide the recommended link to download
based on your operating system.
<a href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download" target="_blank">Download
RStudio</a></p>
<p>You should not need to change any of the default settings as you work
through the installation process. If you are having any issues with the
downloading and installation process please make sure that you have
administrator rights on the computer you are working on.</p>
<p>If you are struggling to complete the installation process then
please ask in the technical support or help forums for these
modules.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-what-is-rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2>What is RStudio?</h2>
<p>Before getting into RStudio - it is worth taking a quick step back to
understand what exactly “R” itself is. Usually when we talk about R we
mean the language itself - but when you downloaded and installed this
you may have seen that R is a standalone program in itself that you
could use. Very occasionally when you look up resources online you will
see people using R without using RStudio. If you search in your program
files you should find it:</p>
<p><img src="images/rlogo.jpg" width="10%" style="display: block; margin: auto auto auto 0;" /></p>
<p>Opening R you see a very old fashioned, and quite intimidating
interface! There are very few features within the R GUI to help you get
started, or to optimise your workflow at all.</p>
<p>You can see a console window in which you can run write and run
commands. So I could try and see if 2+2 still equals 4:</p>
<p><img src="images/Rinterface.JPG" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>And I can see that R is at least functioning correctly as a
calculator.</p>
<p>The general user un-friendliness is what led to the development of
IDEs (Interactive Development Environment) for R, to help make working
with R easier. RStudio was not the first of these, but over time it has
developed to become by far the dominant tool used by those working with
R (the language) on a regular basis. In a 2021 survey 83% of R users
indicated they use RStudio as the way in which they interacted with R
(<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2021/r/"
class="uri">https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2021/r/</a>).
Looking into the methodology, and given the skew in that sample towards
software developers rather than researchers, I would actually suspect
that to be an underestimate!</p>
<p>You can now close down the “R” window.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-overview-of-rstudio-layout" class="section level2">
<h2>Overview of RStudio Layout</h2>
<p>First let’s open up RStudio. It should look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/empty.PNG" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Here you will see three main “panes” initally.</p>
<ul>
<li>Left hand side: This is the console window, by default this is where
you can type in commands, run code and where output would be displayed.
You will notice this part looks extremely similar to what you saw when
you opened up “R” the standalone software application earlier.
Effectively this is exactly the same thing - and now everything else
covered from this point on will be specific to only RStudio.</li>
<li>Top right - by default this shows the “environment” pane. This is
where all of your stored objects will be listed. You can also see a
history of your recently submitted commands, a list of open connections
to external data sources, and some built in tutorials that could help
you on specific topics.</li>
<li>Bottom right - this is also a multi-purpose pane where by default it
links to the file manager so you can open and view files within R. If
you create plots then these will appear in the Plots tab; although
interactive plots or other interactive output will appear in the Viewer
tab and if you create any powerpoint style presentations these will
appear in the Presentation tab. The Packages tab shows a list of the
currently installed packages, and allows you to install new packages or
update existing packages. You can also see a point-and-click access to
the help menus. This is another way to access the same help menus we
mentioned in module 1 which can appear by typing
<code>?functionname</code> into the console.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to totally re-organise the layourt of these panes if
you want - but for now I will assume you are happy with these default
layouts.</p>
<p>Rather than starting straight from from scratch right now, let’s work
with a pre-existing set of file which should hopefully look familiar -
the solutions from Module 1 of this course. These can be downloaded
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stats4sd/RCourse_2023_download_files/dev/Module%201%20Solutions.Rmd" download>from
this link. Right click and select “Save Link As” to download to a
sensible folder on your computer </a></p>
<p>Open the file “Module 1 Solutions.RMD” in RStudio, using the menu
system within RStudio by selecting File (in the top left corner) and
then Open File.</p>
<p>Once opened, your window should look something like this</p>
<p><img src="images/Window.JPG" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Now you will see four panes - and this is usually what you will have
when working with R Studio. The console has dropped to the bottom left
and the scripting window has appeared in the top left.</p>
<p>One of the first things I would generally suggest doing is minimising
the console window. We never want to write commands in the console
window directly - as these are just temporary. Always use some form of a
script file so that you can keep a track of all of the commands you are
writing. It’s important in research to make sure our work is
reproducible - and using a script allows us to easily identify and fix
errors can be easily, build upon existing analysis, or run the same
analysis again using different data. Let’s look at this now in more
detail.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-r-markdown-files" class="section level2">
<h2>R Markdown Files</h2>
<p>Now let’s take a look at the script file you have opened. The format
being using in this course is a .RMD (R Markdown) file. Within this
format you can write notes and have interactive code chunks, with
in-line output like you have been seeing with the online tutorials.
Pressing the green ‘play’ button to the right of the chunk of code will
run the code. The output will then appear directly below the code within
the RMD document.</p>
<p><img src="images/RunningCode.JPG" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Make good use of the spaces between the chunks of code - you can
write whatever you like in these spaces outside of the code chunks! This
is extremely useful for you to add comments as you work through your
analysis - explaining the logic behind particular steps, or reminding
yourself of key pieces of information.</p>
<p>You can add in new R chunks anywhere in the markdown file - the
easiest way to do this is to select the green “C” button in the top
right corner of the script file and then select “R”</p>
<p><img src="images/newchunk.JPG" width="30%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><em>Exercise: Work your way through the solutions file and run all of
the chunks of code. Notice that some of them will produce errors, and
you will see how these errors and warnings are handled in the markdown
file as you proceed.</em></p>
<p>When working on your own analyses there are a few important things to
remember about creating script files:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Work sequentially! Make sure data is loaded at the beginning and
be sure to put any data manipulation steps in before moving into
analysis, otherwise you may end up with changes not being applied
corrects.</p></li>
<li><p>Unless you are sharing your file with someone else to try to
resolve an error, don’t include all of your ‘failed’ attempts at writing
code within the script file - only keep the code that works. We would
like to have clear organisation of our commands, and not have things
included that don’t work.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the areas around the code chunks to write explanations and
comments about what you are doing, and why you are doing it.
Particularly if you have come across something new or exciting. Or
(following from pt 2) if you get stuck- you can write the commands that
are not working outside of code chunks and include notes about your
problems. The code you are writing may make perfect sense to you right
now - but when you come back next week, or next month… or next year, it
might not make so much sense then.</p></li>
<li><p>Be careful about breaking the formatting style of the code
chunks, by accidentally modifying or deleting the way they appear. It is
safer to use the “Insert-&gt;R” button from the top right to add in
chunks rather than try to write these out, or copy them.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When you have worked down to the bottom of the solutions you will
have reached the examples where objects were created to solve problems.
So you should have seen things start to appear in the ‘environment’
pane, which will show you all of the user created objects produced in
this R session.</p>
<p><img src="images/objects%20in%20environment.JPG" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>There are two kinds of object produced in this session - ‘data’ and
‘values’. Notice that there is a blue button next to the
<code>airquality</code> data. Clicking on the blue button will show you
the column names, the class of each of the columns (integer, numeric,
character) and the first few entries in each column.</p>
<p><img src="images/blue_button.jpg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Clicking on the name of the dataset will open up a spreadsheet view
that will let you explore the data - similar to how you could in excel.
Although note that the data cannot be edited through this spreadsheet
view.</p>
<p><img src="images/viewer.JPG" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>There are two other formats of script file it is also worth being
aware of:</p>
<p>The .R (R Script) format, which is a older and contains only commands
- the output is not shown in line for the .R file, instead it goes to
the console. containing the solutions you can see two distinct types of
content on the page.</p>
<p>The .QMD (Quarto) format, which is very similar to the .RMD format on
the surface but is much newer. The main difference is that this format
has better cross-language compatibility, if for example you start
wanting to use Python and R in the same analysis, or more generally just
use the same setup for coding in Python as you use for coding in R.
Longer term this format may start to get more usage - but as of 2022 it
is still new and not widely adopted, so we would recommend using the
.RMD format as it is likely you will find it easier to get support for
this in case of problems and in this course at least, we are only
focused on running R code.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-installing-packages" class="section level2">
<h2>Installing Packages</h2>
<p>In modules 2 and 3 we used the packages <code>ggplot2</code> and
<code>dplyr</code> for graphics and data manipulation. These are
additional libraries, not included with the ‘base’ installation of R. If
you are using R and RStudio for the first time these packages will not
be available to you.</p>
<p>There are two main ways of installing packages - let’s look at one
for <code>ggplot2</code> and another option for <code>dplyr</code></p>
<p>Option 1: Write a command</p>
<p>Create a new R chunk within the existing .RMD file and write the
command <code>install.packages</code>. The argument needed for this
function is simply the name of the package you wish to install and then
the package name in quotation marks.</p>
<p><img src="images/ggplot2.JPG" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Then running this command will download the package and install it on
your computer.</p>
<p>Check the final message which appears. If you see something which
ends with ‘success’ then the package has installed correctly! If you see
an error message after trying to install a package then you have run
into an issue. Don’t be afraid to ask for help if you come across issues
in this process for package installation at first, as there can
sometimes be firewall, or other compatibility issues, which can be
resolved with a bit of technical support.</p>
<p>The alternative option is to navigate to the packages tab in the
bottom right pane and then click on the ‘install’ button. This will open
a new menu where you can specify which packages you want to install.
Let’s use this method to install dplyr</p>
<p><img src="images/package_menu.JPG" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Just because we have installed our packages does not mean we can use
them though! Maybe I want to apply what I learnt in Module 2 and make a
scatter plot from the airquality data set.</p>
<p><img src="images/not_found.JPG" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Did I make a mistake in the code? Actually - no. Look at the error
message; “could not find function ggplot”.</p>
<p>When you see this error it usually means one of two things: either
you have made a spelling error or, like now, you have not loaded the
library in which the function you are trying to use is stored. In this
case I need to make sure I load the ggplot2 library so that I can have
access to the ggplot command.</p>
<p>We need to load any additional packages we have downloaded within our
R session using the <code>library</code> command within every R session
in which we plan on using it. But we only need to download and install
the packages one time.</p>
<p>So let’s try my code again - but this time running
<code>library(ggplot2</code>) directly before:</p>
<p><img src="images/ggplot_found.JPG" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>It’s usually good practice to load all libraries you use in a script
file in a setup chunk as the very first thing you include in your R
script.</p>
<p>Once you have finished it is usually a good idea to save your script
file - in a sensible folder with a sensible file name. Since you
downloaded the module 1 solutions and then opened the file that had
already been created if you were to save the file now, it would
over-write the version you had previously downloaded. So it is probably
a good idea to use Save-As and then create a new copy. Files can quickly
start to build up when using RStudio - it is good to try to be organised
and this is where project files can come in.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-working-with-projects" class="section level2">
<h2>Working with projects</h2>
<p>Once you have saved any changes let’s now move to a completely
different task - thinking now about the solutions to Module 2. You can
download a zip file containing the solutions for Module 2 in RMD format,
and the data file used, in CSV format <a
href="https://github.com/stats4sd/RCourse_2023_download_files/raw/dev/Module-2-Solutions.zip">here</a></p>
<p>First of all - we should start by extracting the contents of that zip
file into a sensible folder somewhere on your computer.</p>
<p>Then we can create a new project in RStudio (File-&gt;New Project)
and setting this to an “Existing Directory” - the folder where you just
extracted these files to. Since we have already got these files
downloaded and organised we can set it to an existing directory, if we
are starting truly from scratch then we would set it to a completely new
folder. Preferably keep the name of this project as something
simple.</p>
<p>As explained in the video, projects are a really useful way of
keeping your work organised, and making it easy to link to input data
files and store output files in a coherent workflow. They save the
hassle of having to constantly working with overly long file paths and
changing your working directory.</p>
<p>In the files pane in the bottom right, you should now see that this
has navigated to the folder you just assigned the project to. It will
also create a new .RProj file, which is the R project file. If you go
away from RStudio, and come back another time you can reload your
session exactly where you left it by opening this .RProj file. Opening
this file will also automatically set your working directory to the
folder in which the project is contained. The project file automatically
saves as you work - once it is set up you almost don’t even need to
think about it again until you find yourself with a different project to
work on! There is also a project menu in the top right corner which will
let you switch between recently used projects, or create new projects.
When working through the later modules of this course we would very
strongly recommend that you set up project files to complete the
exercises - this will make following the code much easier as you will be
able to locate and import datasets much more easily.</p>
<p>Project files are especially useful for when working in collaborative
projects or when switching between machines so that you can keep any
file path references consistent and not have to potentially change them.
Writing import statements to specific file locations can quickly turn
into horribly long lines of code - and they will only ever be specific
to your computer so would have to be amended by anyone else you shared
the code with.</p>
<p>As the file pane should now be showing you the folder where you
extracted the module 2 solutions, you should be able to open it by just
clicking on it.</p>
<p>If you have set the project file, and installed ggplot you should now
be able to go through the solutions file and run each of the chunks of
code to see the ‘solved’ answers.</p>
<p>Make sure you work through the code for Module 2 sequentially.
Loading the packages and the data first, otherwise the later steps will
not run.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-importing-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Importing Data</h2>
<p>You can see from the first chunk of the Module 2 solutions that we
now introduce a new function <code>read.csv</code> being used to read
the data file in. As long as you set up your project correctly, this
line will read in the datafile and store it in R as an object called
Pulse. When you run this line you should see it appear in your
environment pane. Importing clean data saved in CSV format is easy!</p>
<p>The next workbook for this module will cover what you need to do if
you find yourself needing to import data from other sources, or that may
not be so clean. A key point to understand is that the cleanliness and
complexity of the structure of your data outside of R will effect how
easy the data is to read in.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-exporting-results" class="section level2">
<h2>Exporting Results</h2>
<p>One of the great things about using R markdown files and R project
files, is how easy it is to export results outside of R. If you have
followed the advice in this module and installed all required packages
then you should be able to easily convert the output from the Module 2
solutions into a beautiful report, in your choice of format
(PDF/Word/HTML) by simply pressing the knit button at the top of the
window and selecting the output format. This will initially ask you to
install a few more packages, and you will always be prompted to save
your document, if there are unsaved changes, before any output is
made.</p>
<p><img src="images/knit.JPG" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto auto auto 0;" /></p>
<p>Try it now using either of the module 2 solutions RMD file.</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways to improve on the default appearance of your
output, but going in detail to this is a little beyond the scope the
course. If you are interested in learning more, see the markdown cheat
